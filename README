So, we have a group of good Ruby developers and a growing need for more intense client-side interaction. I'm going to attempt put together some demos in this repo that walk through the more foreign bits of JavaScript. I'm also going to throw in some bits that demonstrate best practices.

_To Do_
Here are some things that I want to talk about but have not yet...

* scope and "this"
* truthy and falsey
* pass by reference
* prototypal inheritance
* classical OOP
