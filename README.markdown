So, we have a good group of Ruby developers and a growing need for more intense client-side interaction. I'm going to attempt to put together some demos in this repo that walk through the more foreign bits of JavaScript. I'm also going to throw in some bits that demonstrate best practices.

# To Do
Here are some things that I want to talk about but have not yet...

* functions (named and unnamed and arguments)
* closure
* typeof (array is 'object')
* prototypal inheritance
* classical OOP
